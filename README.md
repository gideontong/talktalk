## Features

* Automatically start a new call and record it
* Keep a schedule and to-do list for podcasters

talktalk is in active development, and if you have a feature request, simply fill out an [issue](https://github.com/gideontong/talktalk/issues) and we will get to it as soon as possible.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository to your hard drive. You'll need [Node 12.x](https://nodejs.org) or another JS code interpreter. Assuming you have Node installed, simply type

```bash
npm install --production
```

and while Node grabs the dependencies for you, move the file in `config/secrets-blank.json` to `config/secrets.json` and replace `token` with your [Discord API key](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Then start the application with

```bash
npm start
```

### Support

If you need support, you can start with reference guides and Google searches.

That said, if you have questions, feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:gideon@smhourheads.com) if you have any questions.
